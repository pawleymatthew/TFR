The Gaussian copula notoriously fails to capture this phenomenon. Two notions in a process or vector context which summarize extremal dependence in a function comparable to a correlation function are the extremal dependence measure (EDM) and the extremogram. We review these ideas and compare the two tools and end with a central limit theorem for a natural estimator of the EDM which allows drawing confidence bands comparable to those provided by Bartlett’s formula in a classical context of sample correlation functions.},

To identify spatial patterns, most well-known statistical techniques are based on the concept of intra- and intercluster variances (like the k-means algorithm or EOFs). As analyzing quantitative extremes like heavy rainfall has become more and more prevalent for climatologists and hydrologists during these last decades, finding spatial patterns with methods based on deviations from the mean (i.e., variances) may not be the most appropriate strategy in this context of studying such extremes. For practitioners, simple and fast clustering tools tailored for extremes have been lacking. A possible avenue to bridging this methodological gap resides in taking advantage of multivariate extreme value theory, a welldeveloped research field in probability, and to adapt it to the context of spatial clustering. In this paper, a novel algorithm based on this plan is proposed and studied. The approach is compared and discussed with respect to the classical k-means algorithm throughout the analysis of weekly maxima of hourly precipitation recorded in France (fall season, 92 stations, 1993–2011).},

In this paper, we address the issue of generating hazard event sets for northern England and southern Scotland, a region which has been particularly affected by flooding over the past years. We start by analysing extreme river flow across 45 gauges in the region using recently introduced ideas from extreme value theory. This results in a set of extremal principal components, with the first components describing the large-scale structure of the observed flood events, and we find interesting connections to the region’s topography and climate. We then introduce a framework to approximate the distribution of the extremal principal components which is dimension reducing in that it distinctly handles the large-scale and local extremal behavior. Synthetic flood events are subsequently generated efficiently by sampling from the fitted distribution. Our approach for generating hazard event sets can be easily implemented by practitioners and our results indicate good agreement between the observed and simulated extreme river flow dynamics.},

  abstract = {Identifying hidden spatial patterns that define sub-regions characterized by a similar behaviour is a central topic in statistical climatology. This task, often called regionalization, is helpful for recognizing areas in which the variables under consideration have a similar stochastic distribution and thus, potentially, for reducing the dimensionality of the data. Many examples for regionalization are available, spanning from hydrology to weather and climate science. However, the majority of regionalization techniques focuses on the spatial clustering of a single variable of interest and is often not tailored to extremes. Extreme events often have severe impacts, which can be amplified when co-occurring with extremes in other variables. Given the importance of characterizing compound extreme events at the regional scale, here we develop an algorithm that identifies homogeneous spatial sub-regions that are characterized by a common bivariate dependence structure in the tails of a bivariate distribution. In particular, we use a novel non-parametric divergence able to capture the similarities and differences in the tail behaviour of bivariate distributions as the core of our clustering procedure. We apply the approach to identify homogeneous regions that exhibit similar likelihood of compound precipitation and wind extremes in Great Britain and Ireland.},

Daily temperature observations and a pair of historical and scenario (greenhouse gas radiative concentration pathway 8.5) simulations with the highresolution (∼12.5 km) ALADIN regional climate model provide a robust framework to examine the spatial distribution of these extreme events and their 21st century evolution. Five regions are identified with an extreme event spatial clustering algorithm applied to observed temperatures. They are used to diagnose the 21st century heatwave spatial patterns. In the 2070s, we find a simulated mega-heatwave as severe as the 2003 observed heatwave relative to its contemporaneous climate. A 20-member initial condition ensemble is used to assess the sensitivity of this future heatwave to the internal variability in the regional climate model and to pre-existing land surface conditions. Even in a much warmer and drier climate in France, late spring dry land conditions may lead to a significant amplification of summer extreme temperatures and heatwave intensity through limitations in evapotranspiration. By 2100, the increase in summer temperature maxima exhibits a range from 6 °C to almost 13 °C in the five regions in France, relative to historical maxima. These projections are comparable with the estimates given by a large number of global climate models.},

Topics include linear regression, classification, resampling methods, shrinkage approaches, tree-based methods, support vector machines, clustering, deep learning, survival analysis, multiple testing, and more. Color graphics and real-world examples are used to illustrate the methods presented. Since the goal of this textbook is to facilitate the use of these statistical learning techniques by practitioners in science, industry, and other fields, each chapter contains a tutorial on implementing the analyses and methods presented in R, an extremely popular open source statistical software platform. Two of the authors co-wrote The Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman, 2nd edition 2009), a popular reference book for statistics and machine learning researchers. An Introduction to Statistical Learning covers many of the same topics, but at a level accessible to a much broader audience. This book is targeted at statisticians and non-statisticians alike who wish to use cutting-edge statistical learning techniques to analyze their data. The text assumes only a previous course in linear regression and no knowledge of matrix algebra.

We introduce an approach based on peaks over thresholds that provides several new estimators for processes 77 in the max-domain of attraction of the frequently used Hüsler-Reiss model and its spatial extension: Brown-Resnick processes. The method relies on increments //(•) - r;(f0) conditional on r/(f0) exceeding a high threshold, where t0 is a fixed location. When the marginals are standardized to the Gumbel distribution, these increments asymptotically form a Gaussian process resulting in computationally simple estimates of the Hüsler-Reiss parameter matrix and particularly enables parametric inference for Brown-Resnick processes based on (high dimensional) multivariate densities. This is a major advantage over composite likelihood methods that are commonly used in spatial extreme value statistics since they rely only on bivariate densities. A simulation study compares the performance of the new estimators with other commonly used methods. As an application, we fit a non-isotropic Brown-Resnick process to the extremes of 12-year data of daily wind speed measurements.},

We propose the rst extreme value spatial clustering methods which account for both the similarity of the marginal tails and the spatial dependence structure of the data to determine the appropriate level of pooling. Spatial dependence is incorporated in two ways: to determine the cluster selection and to account for dependence of the data over sites within a cluster when making the marginal inference. We introduce a statistical model for the pairwise extremal dependence which incorporates distance between sites, and accommodates our belief that sites within the same cluster tend to exhibit a higher degree of dependence than sites in di erent clusters. By combining the models for the marginal tails and the dependence structure, we obtain a composite likelihood for the joint spatial distribution. We use a Bayesian framework which learns about both the number of clusters and their spatial structure, and that enables the inference of site-speci c marginal distributions of extremes to incorporate uncertainty in the clustering allocation. The approach is illustrated using simulations, the analysis of daily precipitation levels in Norway and daily river ow levels in the UK. Code and data for the simulation study and river ow example are available in the online supplementary materials.},

  abstract = {To mitigate the risk posed by extreme rainfall events, we require statistical models that reliably capture extremes in continuous space with dependence. However, assuming a stationary dependence structure in such models is often erroneous, particularly over large geographical domains. Furthermore, there are limitations on the ability to fit existing models, such as max-stable processes, to a large number of locations. To address these modelling challenges, we present a regionalisation method that partitions stations into regions of similar extremal dependence using clustering. To demonstrate our regionalisation approach, we consider a study region of Australia and discuss the results with respect to known climate and topographic features. To visualise and evaluate the effectiveness of the partitioning, we fit max-stable models to each of the regions. This work serves as a prelude to how one might consider undertaking a project where spatial dependence is non-stationary and is modelled on a large geographical scale.},

Coherent seasonal spatial patterns of timing and magnitude are evident in the data, motivating a seasonally based analysis. Using a clustering method that is consistent with extreme value theory, we identify coherent regions for extremes that vary seasonally. Based on storm back trajectory analysis, we demonstrate unique moisture sources and dominant moisture pathways for each spatial region. In the winter the Pacific Ocean is the dominant moisture source across the west, but in other seasons the Gulf of Mexico, the Gulf of California, and the land surface over the midwestern U.S. play an important role. We find the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) to not have a strong impact on dominant moisture delivery pathways or moisture sources. The frequency of extremes under ENSO is spatially coherent and seasonally dependent with certain regions tending to have more (less) frequent extreme events in El Niño (La Niña) conditions.},

A heuristic criterion is proposed to choose the threshold over which it is acceptable to consider observations as extreme and the appropriate number of clusters. When empirically evaluated through numerical experiments, the approach we promote here is found to be very efficient under some regularity constraints, even in dimension 20. For illustration purpose, we also carry out a case study in dietary risk assessment.},

  abstract = {Unlabeled document collections are becoming increasingly common and available; mining such data sets represents a major contemporary challenge. Using words as features, text documents are often represented as high-dimensional and sparse vectors–a few thousand dimensions and a sparsity of 95 to 99\% is typical. In this paper, we study a certain spherical k-means algorithm for clustering such document vectors. The algorithm outputs k disjoint clusters each with a concept vector that is the centroid of the cluster normalized to have unit Euclidean norm. As our first contribution, we empirically demonstrate that, owing to the high-dimensionality and sparsity of the text data, the clusters produced by the algorithm have a certain “fractal-like” and “selfsimilar” behavior. As our second contribution, we introduce concept decompositions to approximate the matrix of document vectors; these decompositions are obtained by taking the least-squares approximation onto the linear subspace spanned by all the concept vectors. We empirically establish that the approximation errors of the concept decompositions are close to the best possible, namely, to truncated singular value decompositions. As our third contribution, we show that the concept vectors are localized in the word space, are sparse, and tend towards orthonormality. In contrast, the singular vectors are global in the word space and are dense. Nonetheless, we observe the surprising fact that the linear subspaces spanned by the concept vectors and the leading singular vectors are quite close in the sense of small principal angles between them. In conclusion, the concept vectors produced by the spherical k- means algorithm constitute a powerful sparse and localized “basis” for text data sets.},

The asymptotic distribution of a vector of nonparametric, rank-based estimators of these coefficients justifies a stopping criterion in an algorithm that searches the collection of all possible groups of variables in a systematic way, from smaller groups to larger ones. The issue that the tolerance level in the stopping criterion should depend on the size of the groups is circumvented by the use of a conditional tail dependence coefficient. Alternatively, such stopping criteria can be based on limit distributions of rank-based estimators of the coefficient of tail dependence, quantifying the speed of decay of joint survival functions. Numerical experiments indicate that the algorithm’s effectiveness for detecting tail-dependent groups of variables is highest when paired with a criterion based on a Hill-type estimator of the coefficient of tail dependence.},

  abstract = {Capturing the dependence structure of multivariate extreme events is a major concern in many fields involving the management of risks stemming from multiple sources, e.g., portfolio monitoring, insurance, environmental risk management and anomaly detection. One convenient (nonparametric) characterization of extreme dependence in the framework of multivariate Extreme Value Theory (EVT) is the angular measure, which provides direct information about the probable ‘‘directions’’ of extremes, i.e., the relative contribution of each feature/coordinate of the largest observations. Modeling the angular measure in highdimensional problems is a major challenge for the multivariate analysis of rare events. The present paper proposes a novel methodology aiming at exhibiting a particular kind of sparsity within the dependence structure of extremes. This is achieved by estimating the amount of mass spread by the angular measure on representative sets of directions corresponding to specific sub-cones of Rd+. This dimension reduction technique paves the way towards scaling up existing multivariate EVT methods. Beyond a non-asymptotic study providing a theoretical validity framework for our method, we propose as a direct application a first anomaly detection algorithm based on multivariate EVT. This algorithm builds a sparse normal profile of extreme behaviors, to be confronted with new (possibly abnormal) extreme observations. Illustrative experimental results provide strong empirical evidence of the relevance of our approach.},

We derive theoretical properties of these indices, demonstrate their value through a series of examples, and develop methods of inference that also estimate the proportion of extremal mass associated with each cone.

Our extreme SAR model extends recent work on transformed-linear operations applied to regularly varying random vectors, and is unique among extremes models in being directly analogous to a classical linear model. An additional appeal is its simplicity; given a proximity matrix W, spatial dependence is described by a single parameter 𝜌. We develop an estimation method that minimizes the discrepancy between the tail pairwise dependence matrix (TPDM) for the fitted model and the estimated TPDM. Applying this method to simulated data demonstrates that it is able to produce good estimates of extremal spatial dependence even in the case of model misspecification, and additionally produces reasonable estimates of uncertainty. We also apply the method to gridded precipitation observations for a study region over northeast Colorado, and find that a single-parameter extreme SAR model paired with a neighborhood structure which accounts for longer range dependence effectively models spatial dependence in these data.},

  abstract = {The French Mediterranean is subject to intense precipitation events occurring mostly in autumn. These can potentially cause flash floods, the main natural danger in the area. The distribution of these events follows specific spatial patterns, i.e., some sites are more likely to be affected than others. The peaks-over-threshold approach consists in modeling extremes, such as heavy precipitation, by the generalized Pareto (GP) distribution. The shape parameter of the GP controls the probability of extreme events and can be related to the hazard level of a given site. When interpolating across a region, the shape parameter should reproduce the observed spatial patterns of the probability of heavy precipitation. However, the shape parameter estimators have high uncertainty which might hide the underlying spatial variability. As a compromise, we choose to let the shape parameter vary in a moderate fashion. More precisely, we assume that the region of interest can be partitioned into subregions with constant hazard level. We formalize the model as a conditional mixture of GP distributions. We develop a two-step inference strategy based on probability weighted moments and put forward a cross-validation procedure to select the number of subregions. A synthetic data study reveals that the inference strategy is consistent and not very sensitive to the selected number of subregions. An application on daily precipitation data from the French Mediterranean shows that the conditional mixture of GPs outperforms two interpolation approaches (with constant or smoothly varying shape parameter).},

  abstract = {Spatial climate data are often presented as summaries of areal regions such as grid cells, either because they are the output of numerical climate models or to facilitate comparison with numerical climate model output. Extreme value analysis can bene t greatly from spatial methods that borrow information across regions. For Gaussian outcomes, a host of methods that respect the areal nature of the data are available, including conditional and simultaneous autoregressive models. However, to our knowledge, there is no such method in the spatial extreme value analysis literature. In this article, we propose a new method for areal extremes that accounts for spatial dependence using latent clustering of neighboring regions. We show that the proposed model has desirable asymptotic dependence properties and leads to relatively simple computation. Applying the proposed method to North American climate data reveals several local and continental-scale changes in the distribution of precipitation and temperature extremes over time. Supplementary material for this article is available online.},

  abstract = {We propose a multivariate extreme value threshold model for joint tail estimation which overcomes the problems encountered with existing techniques when the variables are near independence. We examine inference under the model and develop tests for independence of extremes of the marginal variables, both when the thresholds are fixed, and when they increase with the sample size. Motivated by results obtained from this model, we give a new and widely applicable characterisation of dependence in the joint tail which includes existing models as special cases. A new parameter which governs the form of dependence is of fundamental importance to this characterisation. By estimating this parameter, we develop a diagnostic test which assesses the applicability of bivariate extreme value joint tail models. The methods are demonstrated through simulation and by analysing two previously published data sets.},

  abstract = {Regular variation provides a convenient theoretical framework to study large events. In the multivariate setting, the dependence structure of the positive extremes is characterized by a measure - the spectral measure - defined on the positive orthant of the unit sphere. This measure gathers information on the localization of extreme events and has often a sparse support since severe events do not simultaneously occur in all directions. However, it is defined through weak convergence which does not provide a natural way to capture this sparsity structure. In this paper, we introduce the notion of sparse regular variation which allows to better learn the dependence structure of extreme events. This concept is based on the Euclidean projection onto the simplex for which efficient algorithms are known. We prove that under mild assumptions sparse regular variation and regular variation are two equivalent notions and we establish several results for sparsely regularly varying random vectors. Finally, we illustrate on numerical examples how this new concept allows one to detect extremal directions.},

  abstract = {Density Estimation is one of the central areas of statistics whose purpose is to estimate the probability density function underlying the observed data. It serves as a building block for many tasks in statistical inference, visualization, and machine learning. Density Estimation is widely adopted in the domain of unsupervised learning especially for the application of clustering. As big data become pervasive in almost every area of data sciences, analyzing high-dimensional data that have many features and variables appears to be a major focus in both academia and industry. Highdimensional data pose challenges not only from the theoretical aspects of statistical inference, but also from the algorithmic/computational considerations of machine learning and data analytics. This paper reviews a collection of selected nonparametric density estimation algorithms for high-dimensional data, some of them are recently published and provide interesting mathematical insights. The important application domain of nonparametric density estimation, such as modal clustering, are also included in this paper. Several research directions related to density estimation and high-dimensional data analysis are suggested by the authors.},
