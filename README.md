## Structure of the repository

Most of the files/folders can be ignored. The following may be of interest:

- The files 'index.Rmd', '01-introduction.Rmd', ..., '05-future-work.Rmd' contain the code and LaTeX to make the report
- The folder 'Code' contains: the French rainfall data; my functions; the stored results of some simulations.
