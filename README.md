## Structure of the repository

Most of the files/folders can be ignored. The following may be of interest:

- The files 'index.Rmd', '01-introduction.Rmd', ..., '05-future-work.Rmd' contain the code and LaTeX to make the report
- I think it is set up to install packages if you haven't already got them installed. If there are package issues, you can find the list of packages in the 'index.Rmd' file.
- The folder 'Code' contains: the French rainfall data; my functions; the stored results of some simulations.
